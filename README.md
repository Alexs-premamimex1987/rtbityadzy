Wow. So I just left the theater after watching Gap, and honestly, my brain feels like someone shook it up in a snow globe. Not in a “oh wow, that was life-changing” kind of way, but more like “did I just spend two hours absorbing an existential microwave beep?” way. 

The movie’s about, well, gaps...literal gaps, emotional gaps, perhaps even the bane of my existence, WiFi gaps. Just throw in a bunch of people who might be having a midlife crisis (or are they just perpetually grumpy?), and you've got the basic gist. It’s like the film was giving me a hearty side-eye every few minutes, daring me to find meaning where there might be none, or I just...I'm too tired to see.

You know when you have a dream that’s both bizarre and weirdly beautiful? Like a raccoon riding a unicycle gently handing out subpoenas. That's Gap. There’s a lush scene where the protagonist just stares at his reflection in, I kid you not, a toaster. And I’m sitting there thinking, Yep, that’s me every Monday. 

> Somewhere near the end, it got all artsy and profound. Or at least tried to. There was this montage, you know, with violins soaring and everyone staring into the distance like they just realized they forgot to take the chicken out of the freezer. And I'm like, was this supposed to make me cry? 'Cause all it did was remind me of my neglected grocery list. 

Here's some randomness for ya: 
```
public void WatchScene(int confoundLevel) { 
    if (confoundLevel > 10) Console.WriteLine(Um, what?);
}
```
Heh, I found that one in my notes. Maybe I thought it’d help...somehow.

Honestly, I’m glad it’s over. Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t awful, just like... a cat trying to perform algebra. Bizarre and weirdly cute in its own tragic way. If you’re curious (or mad), download the movie and go on this twisted ride yourself. But don’t come crying to me if you end up just as baffled.
